Purpose
---------

To prepare students for a learning experience in data science there is
a baseline amout of linear algebra, calculus, programming,
and statistics that essentially act as a barrior to entry for aspiring learners.

This content focuses on the linear algebra part. It makes use of the
numeric computing package in Python so a basic understanding of Python
is necessary.
